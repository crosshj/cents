INBOX
  - create paycheck view
  - make a desktop version
  - create a brighter theme
  - show hidden / hide
  - show projected payoff date in popup
  - scroll history graph
  - dayjs versus moment

GROUPED ACCOUNTS
  - amount that is shown due/pending should only be that due within period
  - should handle recurring period properly: month/bi-month/weekly/bi-week/annual

REDESIGN UI
  - do away with 3 tabs at top or move to bottom
  - make current debt list a stream of paychecks which expands to show debts for that check
  - remove inline action and use FAB for adding new item
  - provide a way to see previous items in stream

GET SCRAPER/AI SERVICE WORKING AGAIN
  - should run as seperate process
  - need UI for adding and editing scrapers

SERVICE WORKER / WEB WORKER
  - redux in web worker
  - service worker should be air-tight
  - still seeing cache issues (submitted values not appearing until refresh)

LOGIN / AUTH
  - this should work for anyone and not be dummy like it is already
  - should track anyone's finances
  - google auth is not verified
    - https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/client-verification#requesting_verification

DESKTOP vs MOBILE
  - desktop should be all-in-one view
  - mobile should be one stream (see above about tabs)

REACT-NATIVE
  - need a build process which converts desktop/mobile to react-native
  - ^^ is this even possible?
